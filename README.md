# Covid-19-ICU-Bed-Requirment-Prediction

# Project Description
Need  to build a model to predict whether the covid -19 patient arrived will be required an ICU bed or not based on data.
This Project is used to predict Covid-19-ICU Bed RequirmentPrediction.Picked up a recent data from a Kaggle website and gain insights from data using matplotlib and seaborn.We will analyze this dataset using Machine learning techniques in order to predict whether the covid -19 patient arrived will be required an ICU bed or not  based on the features provided in the columns of the dataset. We will begin the Data Science Life Cycle to process the data such as Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, splitting dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

# Modelling and Evaluation

# Algorithms used

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Adaboost and xgboost Classifier

Metric - Since the target variable is a Categorical variable.Also the data is imbalance.Classification evaluation metrics Recall, precision and F1 score have been used.

Random forest classifier performed better than other classification algorithm with accuracy score 92%.
